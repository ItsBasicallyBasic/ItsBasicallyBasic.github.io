                            The Mech AI Tournament was a fun way to inspire students to think
                            creatively and competitively for our final assignment for AI for Games (IGB383).
                            I successfully created an AI that uses behaviour trees in order to make
                            human-like decisions during combat. My AI successfully made it to the finals

                        <p>
                            "Sploosh!" is one of my larger projects that was worked on by myself and
                            3 others. We were tasked by our industry partner, Starlight Foundation,
                            to create a game for 4 - 6 year olds that would teach them how to use
                            a controller. We decided to make a platforming game with a paint theme similar to 'DeBlob''
                            that could teach children how a single joystick and 5 button inputs can affect
                            the game world. We wanted to keep the amount of inputs required to play the game
                            to a minimum so that children would not be overwhelmed. Below is some game play to
                            showcase our final result.

                            "Tippy Shippy" is a small project made by myself and 2 others that revolved
                            around key words 'spam', 'rows', and 'balance'. These words were provided
                            during the assignment to encourage us to think creatively about how we
                            could incorporate these words into main mechanics or visuals for the game.
                            Our group created a game where the objective was to <b>balance</b> a cargo
                            ship, while boxes are <b>'spammed'</b> toward the player. The player prevented
                            the ship from capsising by stacking the crates in <b>rows</b> on either side
                            of the ship.

                            "Lime Rider" is a small project that was worked on by myself and 2 others
                            for a mini-game development class. It is a game inspired by the tendy
                            and new Lime scooters that were recently released for public use early 2019.
                            As the player you must evade pedestrians and other lime scooter users as
                            you traverse a procedurally generated city-like environment. The goal is
                            to travel as far as possible by collecting batteries to recharge your
                            scooter on the go. The player must be careful though because hitting
                            anything will greatly deplete charge.

                                "Farout" is the first title I worked on during my university studies.
                                The project was made entirely by me from scratch in Unity3D.
                                It is a top-down zombie shooter game where the player is focused on
                                fighting off waves of super fast zombies while also trying to find
                                the extraction zone. The game focuses on fast-paced combat and there
                                is a plethora of weapons that the player can find and use to defend
                                themselves. There is also a simple AI detection system in place,
                                so zombies actually react to sound and sight. This means stealth is
                                also an option! The illustration on the right was also created by me
                                as a logo for the game.

                            many in-depth systems within the game, so the visuals are very dull.
                            However, my focus was not to create a visually pleasing game, but
                            rather one with fun and meaningful mechanics. The following mechanics
                            shown in both videos below display a high attention to detail within them.

                            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                "HunGrrr!" is the latest title that I'm creating for IGB400 to help
                                polish my portfolio. I thought up the game name, along with the idea
                                during the semester break and thought that IGB400 would give me
                                the perfect opportunity to refine that idea into a fully-fledged
                                game that I would release onto the Google Play Store.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have always thought it would be nice to get myself into the industry
                                as quickly as possible, so this project would act as a final piece to
                                really kickstart my career. In terms of the industry I would fit into,
                                I always thought it would be nice to work on smaller projects and
                                work my way up the chain, gaining experience and learning from those
                                around me as I go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After much research into the kind of jobs that fit within my description,
                                I found myself stumbling upon a lot of mobile game companies. I have never
                                made a mobile game before so I thought that was the perfect platform to create
                                this project on. In summary, the skills I wanted to refine during this project are:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            <h3>In-Depth Description of the Idea</h3>
                            <p>
                                In "HunGrrr!" the player will control a horde of zombies using a single touch screen joystick.
                                Controlling a horde of zombies as opposed to controlling a human survivor makes this game a more
                                unique and fresh experience among others in its genre.
                                The goal of the player is to infect as many humans as possible and destroy as much of
                                the city as possible before the timer runs out. The idea behind this game draws inspiration from
                                games like 'Katamari', 'Donut County', and 'Agar.io'. This is because when your horde grows
                                larger you will be able to destroy larger buildings and monuments which will score you more
                                points and allow you to infect the people that are seeking refuge inside. The twist behind
                                this neat mini-game is the player will have a hunger meter that slowly drains. The more zombies
                                you have in your horde, the faster your hunger meter will deplete. The only way to refill your
                                hunger meter is to keep infecting more humans, so you have to be quick!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If I manage to implement the above and I still have time remaining, I would like to create
                                additional systems to assist with replayability value. Replayability will play a huge role in this
                                game as standard play sessions will only last a few minutes. The standard game loop I explained
                                above will keep players entertained, but not for long term play. Other systems I hope to implement
                                are:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <pre class="tab">       •   Short skill / ability trees </br></pre>
                                <pre class="tab">       •   Random events </br></pre>
                                <pre class="tab">       •   Fast day / night cycle </br></pre>
                                <pre class="tab">       •   Achievements </br></pre>
                                <pre class="tab">       •   In-game store with cosmetics </br></pre>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Time Management</h3>
                            <p>
                                <img src="images/hungrrrproject/map-sketch.jpg" width="50%" style="float:right;" />
                                Obviously this is a large project to take on with about 7 weeks remaining until it is due.
                                So the question remains, <i>will I be able to complete everything in time?</i>.
                                Lucky for me I have already got a headstart as this was an idea I have had since the start
                                of the semester so I have had a really long time to refine my ideas. I have also had some
                                time to think of all the visual assets needed, as well as how the game world will look.
                                I have pretty much covered all design elements of the game before the assignment has even
                                started, that is a pretty helpful headstart! I plan to follow a strict schedule during
                                development. This means that if a feature is not working as intended after a week of
                                development, it will be cut from the game. If there is extra time at the end of the project
                                this feature may be worked on again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having only 7 weeks left it is important to allocate that time properly. A broad outline
                                of the development timeline is as follows:

                            </p>
                            <h3>Mobile Limitations</h3>
                            <p>
                                Obviously being a mobile game, there are significant hardware limitations in comparison
                                to PC, which is the platform that I am used to building for. I have decided to use Unity3D to develop
                                the game as that is what I am most familiar with optimising in. This is extremely important
                                as a steady 30+ FPS is important to maintain for smooth and enjoyable gameplay experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unity also offers tools and well written documentation that make development of a mobile game
                                much faster. In addition to this Unity also has a tethered option to stream the build from the editor
                                directly to the phone via Unity Remote 5. This tool does not represent actual performance on mobile,
                                so throughout development I will be constantly playtesting builds on different phones
                                to check performance. If any major issues are found during these tests, they will be assesed
                                and redesigned accordingly. Complex lighting, textures and polygons are out of the question if I wanted to build
                                the large map illustrated earlier in the post. This will make picking a simplistic, but stylised art style
                                extremely important.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Art Style</h3>
                            <p>
                                The game world and everything inside it will be made up of small voxels that follow a 'vector-like' structure.
                                What I mean by that is that shapes represented within the game world only use 90 degree bends. The colour palette
                                will be bright and vibrant as oppossed to the usual dull colours you would expect from an apocolypic zombie game.
                                This not only makes this game more unique in its category, but also keeps players eyes entertained.
                                A very simple 'box-like' art style, similar to popular mobile game 'Crossy Road'. This is important because a
                                simple and clean art style that is easy to read is the perfect match for a game that is tied to very strict hardware
                                limitations. The models pictured in the images below are a few that I have been working on this week to showcase
                                the look and feel of the game.
